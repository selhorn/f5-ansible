Exposing confidential information
---------------------------------

When submitting a request for help or feedback, you should NEVER:

- Expect that F5 Technical Support will reply to your request. They will not.

If you need more in-depth technical assistance, you can ask us to contact you privately.

Supported BIG-IP versions
-------------------------

The F5 Modules for Ansible are supported on BIG-IP VE versions later than 12.0.0.

For a detailed list of BIG-IP VE versions that are currently supported, see |k5903|.

When a version of BIG-IP reaches end of technical support, it is supported until the next Ansible release.

For example, if a version of BIG-IP reaches end of technical support on January 1, and Ansible releases a new version on March 1, then the F5 Modules for Ansible are supported on that version of BIG-IP until March 1.

F5 does not back-port changes to earlier versions of Ansible.

F5 develops the Ansible modules in tandem with the REST API, and newer versions of BIG-IP provide better support for the REST API.

Supported modules
-----------------

F5 modules are included when you install Ansible. These modules are informally supported by F5 employees.

F5 modules are also in the |github_repo|. These modules are also informally supported by F5 employees, but you should consider these modules to be experimental and not production-ready.

However, if the module's DOCUMENTATION block has a completed ``Tested platforms`` section, then the module is likely complete and ready for use. You can file bugs against modules that are complete.

.. code-block:: python

   # Tested platforms:
   #
   #    - 12.0.0
   #
